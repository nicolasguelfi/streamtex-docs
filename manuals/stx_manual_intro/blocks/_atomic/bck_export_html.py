**Typical sizes:**
- Text-only document: 50-200 KB
- With images (optimized): 500 KB - 2 MB
- Complex layouts: 1-5 MB

**Best practices:**
- Compress images before including
- Use CSS instead of images for simple graphics
- Remove interactive elements from exported content
- Test export size regularly
